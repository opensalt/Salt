Firebase
--------

In order to set up the real-time notification feature for editors there
has to be at least one supported transport available.

Google's Firebase realtime database is the initial transport
implementation that has been developed.  The free tier should suffice
for low volume use, it includes 100 simulateous connections, 1 GB of
data storage, and 10 GB of data transfer per month.
